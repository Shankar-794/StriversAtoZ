# 🔹 Length of the longest subarray with zero Sum
## 🧩 Problem Statement: Given an array containing both positive and negative integers, we have to find the length of the longest subarray with the sum of all elements equal to zero.
## 📌 Examples
Example 1:
Input:
 N = 6, array[] = {9, -3, 3, -1, 6, -5}  
Result:
 5  
Explanation:
 The following subarrays sum to zero:
- {-3, 3}
- {-1, 6, -5}
- {-3, 3, -1, 6, -5}
The length of the longest subarray with sum zero is 5.

Example 2:
Input:
 N = 8, array[] = {6, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 4, -10}  
Result:
 8  
Explanation:
 Subarrays with sum zero:
- {-2, 2}
- {-8, 1, 7}
- {-2, 2, -8, 1, 7}
- {6, -2, 2, -8, 1, 7, 4, -10}
The length of the longest subarray with sum zero is 8.

## 🧠 Optimal Approach
Algorithm
Initialize a variable sum = 0, which stores the sum of elements traversed so far, and another variable max = 0, which stores the length of the longest subarray with sum zero.
Declare a HashMap<Integer, Integer> to store the prefix sum of every element as a key and its index as a value.
Traverse the array and add the array element to the sum.
If sum = 0, update max with the maximum value between max and current_index + 1, as the subarray from the start to the current index has a sum of 0.
If sum is not equal to zero, check the HashMap to see if we've encountered this sum before.
If the HashMap contains the sum, this indicates that a subarray with the same sum exists, so update max accordingly.
If the sum is not found in the HashMap, insert (sum, current_index) into the HashMap to store the prefix sum until the current index.
After traversing the entire array, the max variable will hold the length of the longest subarray with a sum equal to zero. Return max.
### ⏲ Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we are using a single pass through the string with two pointers, leading to linear time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using a fixed-size hash array of size 256 (for ASCII characters) and not using any additional data structures that grow with input size.
