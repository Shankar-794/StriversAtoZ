Count Maximum Consecutive One's in the array


Problem Statement: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array..

Examples
Example 1:
Input: prices = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
Output: 3
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1’s and three consecutive 1’s in the array out of which maximum is 3.

Example 2:
Input: prices = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1} 
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two consecutive 1's in the array.

Algorithm

We need to find the longest streak of consecutive 1’s in a binary array. A simple idea is to traverse the array while maintaining a counter. Every time we encounter a 1, we increase the counter. If we encounter a 0, the streak breaks, so we reset the counter to 0. At each step, we track the maximum streak length seen so far.

Initialize two variables:
cnt → counts the current streak of 1’s.
maxi → stores the maximum streak found so far.
Traverse through the array:
If nums[i] == 1, increment cnt.
If nums[i] == 0, reset cnt to 0.
Update maxi = max(maxi, cnt) at each step.
Finally, return maxi, which contains the length of the longest consecutive 1’s.
